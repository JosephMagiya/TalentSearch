# TalentSearch
## A website where people can show case their work message each other and vote for projects.

- I used Python, Django, HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript to build the website.
- For the database I used dblite3 on localhost then moved to Postgres on AWS to store the data from the website. 
- AWS S3 is used to store the static files
- Sign up, interact with others and enjoy!
- Spotted an area of improvement, reach out! I'm always curious to learn!
